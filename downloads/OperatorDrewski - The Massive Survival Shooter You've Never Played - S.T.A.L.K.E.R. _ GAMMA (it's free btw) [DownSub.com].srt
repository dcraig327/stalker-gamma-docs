1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,240
2022 hasn't been a great year for gaming

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,980
and I feel like we probably say that

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,080
about every year but this year in

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,200
particular is bad for a unique reason 22

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,940
hasn't had any controversial launches

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,799
like the broken state of Fallout 76's

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,260
release or micro transactions in

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,539
Battlefront 2 but this year has game

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,460
developers seemingly attempting to

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,320
release games with solid structures

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,720
fixable issues and low content on launch

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,880
but then absolutely ignoring the game

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,220
for six months after that launch Armory

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,220
forger Battlefield 2042 Halo infinite

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,840
games that make me question whether

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,579
these Publishers just forgot to plan

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,440
beyond their games launch or whether

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,780
they just decided that one-fifth of the

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,879
content upon release should be enough to

20
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,980
keep the gamers bellies full until the

21
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,340
next one right AAA keeps falling short

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,440
so the gamer looks Elsewhere for their

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,260
late night distractions Indie Games

24
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,140
modded games maybe but one game one game

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,460
gets it right

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,399
foreign

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:30,259
[Music]

28
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:33,479
well three games built over 15 years ago

29
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,119
adjusted improved combined into one

30
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,680
single downloadable file that you can

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,560
grab for free and play on any PC with a

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,860
graphics card

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,900
foreign

34
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,759
anomaly a modic conjunction and overhaul

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,740
of stalker shadow of Chernobyl clear sky

36
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,299
and call of pripyat that aims to create

37
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,340
a deep challenging sandbox survival

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,780
experience that can be adjusted to your

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,820
exact preference of things like bullet

40
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,159
damage Trader costs enemy spawn chances

41
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,600
where you can select a difficulty

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,579
setting like I did and go for the ride

43
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,700
anomaly is immense over 100 hours of

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,740
gameplay are sitting here easily with

45
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,720
high replayability due to the dynamic

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,400
events missions and enemy encounters

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,620
that occur all over the zone different

48
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,180
factions you can choose from that play

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,220
in entirely separate ways with different

50
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,560
starting equipment and locations and a

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,000
library of mods are even better yet

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,640
handcraft mod packages to download and

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,260
tweak the experience to your liking

54
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,420
recently I downloaded a pack of bots for

55
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,879
anomaly from a Teensy little mod pack

56
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,580
called stalker gamma gamma is created by

57
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,260
a guy named grock in his community of

58
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,060
cheeky breekies and is actively

59
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,280
maintained adjusted added to depending

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,379
on what grok or Crocs Community votes

61
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,040
for this is anomaly on steroids my PC

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,680
set updating for two hours and once it

63
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,840
was done I witnessed the program I let

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,260
run rampant on my computer install over

65
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,180
320 individual mods to my stalker game

66
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,920
with a convenient program where I can

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,780
disable or change any mod to suit my

68
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,060
needs equipped with subsections tags and

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,680
a search bar to help me find mods to

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,440
change them out I ran the game once and

71
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,540
immediately had a performance issue well

72
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,000
here we go again mods lagging my game

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,040
what's new every now and then I would

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,319
just stutter nothing would cause it I

75
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,640
could be underground above ground in

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,099
Cordon maybe the great swamps and every

77
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,879
few seconds my game would

78
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,800
gameplay wonder if there's something

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,260
that could fix these

80
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,760
stutters

81
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,819
there is no way this works that is so

82
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,680
different from any modding experience

83
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,980
I've ever had in any game boom I was in

84
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,159
stalker gamma 320 mods on top of stalker

85
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,959
anomaly's gigantic overhaul already

86
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,900
running smoothly I was ready to start my

87
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,640
nightly Adventures deep into a new

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,680
version of the dark and depressing land

89
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,540
of post-apocalypse Ukraine

90
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,480
foreign

91
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,459
Sky faction I began my quest to survive

92
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,959
the most dangerous regions of the Zone

93
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,060
but to do that I'd need better armor

94
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,799
better skills better weapons better

95
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,659
pizza and the less you choose to run

96
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,980
with a more hostile or maybe

97
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,080
militaristic faction you'll be working

98
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,239
your way up slowly from plinking Bandits

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,860
with a Makarov hunting small game with

100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,959
an over under or risking yeeding your

101
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:17,579
femur to the next rookie Village for

102
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,320
some weaker artifact out of the local

103
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,959
anomaly field this First Act of an

104
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,960
anomaly playthrough by itself is a game

105
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,820
worth of content and fun

106
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,600
hear it whoa

107
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,699
oh my gosh there were two of them

108
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,000
the early bit of hard difficulty is

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,620
where you have low ammo and few

110
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,840
medications in case of injury fleeing

111
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,940
most of the dangers you encounter it's a

112
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,500
treacherous Zone with Bandits zombies

113
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,080
mutants and radiation at every turn I

114
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,300
was consistently drunk on vodka in my

115
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,280
first playthrough to sway radiation

116
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,680
poisoning as my uniform and gas masks

117
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
were futile against the clouds of

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
radioactive dust I was commonly out of

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
bandages meaning one scratch could mean

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,060
certain death and it's not an unfair

121
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,740
difficulty it might sound like it but

122
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,300
you can and will be able to eventually

123
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,580
catch a lucky break find a body with a

124
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,440
rifle that actually is fixable at the

125
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,900
workbench and feel that massive level of

126
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,820
accomplishment as you finally down

127
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,820
another human with a single shot it's

128
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,800
also the moments in between firefights

129
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,020
though that feel so alive in this game

130
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,820
and are so entertaining it's the moments

131
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,800
where it's 4 am I'm still playing

132
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,720
stalker and I'm sitting on the side of a

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,280
destroyed building just watching a

134
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,320
sunrise while faint gunshots and

135
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,240
occasional mutants Howl in the distance

136
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,120
the world is fully single player yet so

137
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,919
many things happen in it that don't rely

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,020
on player input at all they aren't even

139
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,340
designed to be within the player's

140
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,380
perception range either firefights can

141
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,360
be barely audible across the map and I

142
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,039
rarely ever know what the context is

143
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,320
behind a distant shot and I have the

144
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,460
option to go interact with these

145
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,080
unscripted events but I'll be risking my

146
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,759
stalker's life against other stalkers

147
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,800
and mutants who are equally as likely to

148
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,900
get one-shotted by a double barrel as I

149
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,820
am here I feel like I'm just another

150
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,160
stalker with matching abilities to one

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,840
walking out of the safe zone right in

152
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,820
front of me to go do a patrol this is

153
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,100
the exact chance I get to dig at Ghost

154
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,460
Recon breakpoint once again so of course

155
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,539
I have to

156
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,620
wow it just spawned the enemies right

157
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,440
beside the friendlies watch them fight

158
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,759
each other

159
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,699
look at this intense firefight

160
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,160
look how am I I'm terrified right now

161
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,800
I am so scared of what could potentially

162
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,300
happen to any of these guys

163
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,800
I mean I mean what what's gonna happen

164
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,500
to him you know are they gonna

165
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,419
oh there goes one you know guns don't

166
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,340
feel powerful

167
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,160
whenever you see

168
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,000
two groups of people fighting right with

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,520
guns about 10 feet away from each other

170
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,919
spraying mags upon mags upon mags of

171
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,139
ammo at each other and not killing each

172
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,419
other immediately how does that make me

173
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,220
feel as the player whenever I shoot

174
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,780
someone and they die immediately does

175
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,100
that make me feel like I'm part of the

176
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,660
world or like I am separate like I'm

177
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,759
cheating in the world if the AI aren't

178
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,620
dangerous on either side because they

179
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,120
can't even kill each other in 30 seconds

180
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,680
how does that make me feel when I'm

181
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,139
fighting the AI in this world you just

182
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:18,240
aren't a person in breakpoint you're a

183
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
God among idiots and stalker you see

184
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,819
people die from one hit you see just how

185
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,860
mortal humans are you shoot someone and

186
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,660
hear them crying as their lungs collapse

187
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,340
or cursing you as they die

188
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,919
foreign

189
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,520
[Music]

190
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,020
you see fellow stalkers discover a body

191
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,759
and Report the dead stalker on the

192
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,080
public chat system and then you see

193
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,520
other stalkers reply with their

194
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
condolences by seeing how quickly and

195
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,740
how often Others May die it makes every

196
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,139
movement every fight every evasion so

197
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,940
much more meaningful for once I feel

198
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,460
mortal in a single player game not just

199
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,800
because I can die but because I can die

200
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,500
just as easily and as quickly as anyone

201
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,720
else here so in which game do I feel

202
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,000
more alive the survival features in

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,380
breakpoint where you can do stuff like

204
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,880
drink water clean your weapons or

205
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,139
scratch down some notes for improved

206
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,300
stats or heavily advertised as a selling

207
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,560
point for the game but are never

208
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,599
required they're optional they don't

209
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,759
even punish you if you ignore them not

210
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,460
drinking water no negative effect of

211
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,560
course it's not a hardcore survival game

212
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,419
but I'll wrap up why I'm saying this in

213
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,639
a second in stalker anomaly you drink

214
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,440
water because it's required you eat

215
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,120
because it's required you get tired and

216
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,620
have to sleep because if you don't you

217
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,179
will get so tired that you won't be able

218
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,039
to walk you must balance your petty

219
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,360
Ernie things from Fetch quests and

220
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,799
mutant nuns to decide whether you want

221
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,479
more vodka to protect you from radiation

222
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,520
or more food to eat to keep your stalker

223
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,980
fast and energized survival is a

224
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,399
requirement

225
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,860
one game was advertised as a tactical

226
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,080
shooter with Survival game elements but

227
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,820
I'm very sure the devs were forced to

228
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,560
reverse the depth of their new survival

229
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,260
system to appeal to a wider audience and

230
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,899
net more sales the output is a weird

231
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,880
offhand throw at survival that feels

232
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,880
half-baked and neutered this mod is a

233
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,500
survival game with hundreds of different

234
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,760
developers coming together with

235
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,160
motivation to create a truly immersive

236
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,500
survival experience without the looming

237
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,839
fear of not appealing to a wide audience

238
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,000
also there's a mod in here called beefs

239
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,519
and vgs and they are the best nvgs of

240
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,680
any video game I've probably ever seen

241
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,620
oh

242
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,540
look at that looks pretty good look at

243
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,660
the outside and then the sparkle the

244
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,380
grain yep so this is this is a pbs7 I

245
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,420
don't know some Russian dual tubes

246
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,399
look at the blur too

247
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,260
it's actually that's really good let's

248
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,420
close

249
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,339
isn't that awesome and then the outside

250
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,140
of the night vision is color and then uh

251
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,820
let me try the quad knots

252
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,160
oh there's quads oh my God

253
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,640
damn that looks good I love the fact

254
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,160
that there's actually color outside of

255
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,320
the tube dude wow as you get a bit

256
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,700
deeper in your playthrough find yourself

257
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,380
a modern weapon obtain a better

258
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,240
equipment to allow yourself into more

259
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,980
dangerous zones you'll find yourself

260
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,560
getting into a rhythm with the game are

261
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,420
you commonly searching for artifacts are

262
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,100
you hunting mutants do you cook your own

263
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,200
food or make do with what the Traders

264
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,660
sell are you heavily combat oriented or

265
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,459
preferred to save money on meds and ammo

266
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,740
by avoiding most of those fights these

267
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,600
are questions you will answer in your

268
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,040
playthrough that will shape your stalker

269
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,779
over time as different pieces of

270
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,820
equipment clothing medications weapons

271
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,160
and ammo types will decide on what style

272
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,839
of gameplay you'll be effective at and

273
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,519
your carrying capacity will not allow

274
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,080
you to carry one of everything until

275
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,360
you're way far in an exosuit and for

276
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,100
reference I'm 25 hours into a

277
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,140
playthrough right now and just fully

278
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,959
repaired a pp19 bison to become my first

279
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,660
functional full auto weapon until then I

280
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,519
was running a Mosin in USP for most the

281
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,320
time crying when anything got closer

282
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,420
than 10 feet

283
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,660
foreign

284
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,100
God Jesus

285
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,820
[ __ ] he's back up

286
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,389
[Music]

287
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,740
foreign

288
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,740
it's a small one too

289
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,360
up like halfway up a ladder

290
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,260
[ __ ] yeah I hate those things too

291
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,760
eventually you'll reach a high enough

292
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,380
reputation with traders that you can buy

293
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,240
better parts and ammo for higher end

294
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,740
weapons and enemies will eventually

295
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,600
spawn with better weapons and gear too

296
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,399
once you drop them and loot their bodies

297
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,380
meaning at some point you'll be able to

298
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,000
progress all the way to a powered

299
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,519
exoskeleton suit and high-end tarkov

300
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,860
like weaponry and I just appreciate that

301
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,019
depth in all chapters of the game from

302
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,660
beginning poor to becoming a high-end

303
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,060
legend in the zone the game throws

304
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,860
logistical curveballs at you and still

305
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,959
surprises you to slow your progression

306
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,060
down to a speed at which you can savor

307
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,100
it switching off of a Mosin Nagant after

308
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,500
days of playing with it was tough It's

309
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,779
been with me for weeks of a playthrough

310
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,579
but I was finally moving on to something

311
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,440
bigger other sections of the experience

312
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,540
have depth due to the already large lore

313
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,220
base of the stalker universe meaning the

314
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,500
Zone can throw a bloodsucker a squad of

315
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,600
heavily geared monolith soldiers Bandits

316
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,399
or a pack of dogs at you from the same

317
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,320
spawn point all with different required

318
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,420
reactions from the player to deal with

319
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,459
safely and similar to other games we

320
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,860
play here on the channel this game is a

321
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,079
massive sandbox with many ways to play

322
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,240
gather your buddies on Discord new

323
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,860
playthrough the player is forced to do

324
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,660
nothing but hunt artifacts take a drink

325
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,639
or shot a vodka when your stalker has to

326
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,139
drink Vodka to negate radiation

327
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,019
poisoning fun ensues all right here we

328
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,100
go well this one I'm not a huge fan of

329
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,639
oh I got I'm stuck

330
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,320
I have to reload because it's not really

331
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,120
that much no problem in the future can

332
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,399
you eat the anomalous bread though

333
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,220
I don't know if that's such a good idea

334
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,160
24 millisieverts an hour can you digest

335
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,740
the radiation your poo would be glowing

336
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,660
green bro you get killed by a

337
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,000
bloodsucker or you die of green poo I'm

338
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,620
gonna pick the green poo every time oh

339
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,899
you're uh resistance just everything by

340
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,980
it is

341
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,680
sipping all right here we go

342
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,959
it's a new Mutant that got added by this

343
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,360
mod and it's basically sounds like a

344
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,839
piranha sounds like a motorboat yeah

345
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,240
basically what it is what it is it's

346
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,680
simple I just want to hear the piranha

347
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,800
sounds like raw in my ear just dude

348
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:14,100
he's got seven artifacts on him Josh

349
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,980
that's you you idiot

350
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,320
dude this is literally me no he turns

351
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,380
around him

352
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,600
you're putting stuff off shots

353
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,720
did you not notice that's what I meant

354
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,459
it's you touched him out

355
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,740
that's a drink water moment

356
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,899
oh yeah oh there's some hardships I am

357
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:48,180
dude you're walking into it dude I don't

358
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,980
have any balls you don't have bolts

359
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
oh that goes crazy super fast fighter

360
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,540
right right fire of rate

361
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,500
how are you

362
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,600
there's more modes than one as well a

363
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,459
fun one in the game is the Iron Man mode

364
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,260
where your save will delete itself after

365
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,060
you run out of a pre-selected amount of

366
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,980
lives or another mode where when you die

367
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,800
you enter the body of another AI stalker

368
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,079
in the zone and play on as that stalker

369
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,120
it's a game that's filled with a Sandbox

370
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,760
of settings and tools to tweak and play

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,339
with to your heart's content seriously

372
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,980
imagine I really want you to imagine a

373
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,079
new single player Survival game dropping

374
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,240
today from some company or any company

375
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
for sixty dollars with the same level of

376
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,300
depth customization and replayability as

377
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,639
this experience IGN would be giving this

378
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
10 out of 10s across the board for its

379
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,420
impressive and unique visuals and high

380
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,399
amount of content immersive environment

381
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,620
sound systems Etc and it have the

382
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,000
biggest streamers hooked on it for

383
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,940
months Instead This is an old game that

384
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,699
was originally one with Big Ideas

385
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:14,040
limited by the era it was born in left

386
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,040
to be played by only few because of the

387
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,019
Prejudice of unaware gamers thinking of

388
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,320
it as old or clunky when in reality the

389
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,360
gameplay of stalker gamma and stalker

390
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,279
anomaly competes with modern day games

391
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,920
so closely because it's been tuned and

392
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,260
adjusted by a crowd-sourced effort for

393
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,199
years much more powerful than any AAA

394
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,180
game Studio this is what you get when

395
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,860
you have people who are actually making

396
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,899
a game based on what they think is cool

397
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,660
versus a game that's made for profit so

398
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,399
if you hear a friend mention that the

399
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,740
gaming landscape is dry right now going

400
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,720
to play a modded stalker experience

401
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,120
isn't just a rewind back for nostalgia's

402
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,579
sake it's a refresh of a formula that's

403
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,259
worked for years and being one of the

404
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,480
top survival experiences in gaming and

405
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,339
if you even want to go deeper stalker

406
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,139
gamma's pack adds a bunch more hardcore

407
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,260
fun to it too so pop a cold one spend a

408
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,059
lonely night in the game it'll make you

409
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,160
jump it'll make you frustrated

410
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,679
but it is undeniably an extreme amount

411
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,079
of value for the price of well nothing

412
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,000
or maybe your spicy internet bill after

413
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,900
downloading 350 mods
